- **Bridge Network**
  collapsed:: true
	- Internal private network, containers are automatically assigned to it usually in the series of 172.17.0.1 network range.
	- Containers are automatically assigned IPs are connected to Bridge network and can communicate with each other.
	- To access containers from outside world, map ports of container to ports of host, making it accessible via Hosts IP address and mapped port no.
	- E.g. ` docker run ubuntu`
- **Host Network**
  collapsed:: true
	- Containers are directly mapped to Host's network.
	- E.g. `docker run --network=host nginx`
- **None**
  collapsed:: true
	- This network type completely isolates the containers in the Docker host
	- E.g. `docker container run --network=none nginx`
- **User Defined Network**
  collapsed:: true
	- User can define their own network, besides the default bridge network
	- Command example - `docker network create --driver bridge --subnet 182.18.0.0/16 custom-isolated network`
	- check using `docker network ls`

	- **Embedded DNS**
	-
- **Embedded DNS**
  collapsed:: true
	- Does not work with default bridge network
	- only works with user defined network
	- Embedded DNS helps containers resolve each other by their name
	- IP address is not useful
	- DNS server is 127.0.0.11 usually in Docker host
	- note that embedded DNS WORKS ONLY WITH USER-DEFINED NETWORK
	- Cannot use internal IPs for communication, as its not ideal, its not guaranteed that container will get same IP when it reboots
	- All containers in docker host can resolve each other with the name of the container. Docker has a build in DNS server (of sorts) at 127.0. 0.11
	- How does docker implement Networking -?
	  collapsed:: true
		- Docker uses network namespaces - **read more**
-
- How do we see existing IP address etc assigned to particular network ? --> Run command `docker container inspect container name`
- `docker network ls` --> list default networks
- `docker container network inspect` container_id or name of container --> see ip address assigned to a network under IPAM (IP address management)
- To connect a custom network to container use --> `docker network connect custom-net my-container`
- You may connect a single container to multiple networks
- `docker network disconnect custom-net my-container`
- `docker network rm custom-net`   /deletes the network
- `docker network prune`    /removes all un-used networks, only works on user-defined not default
