- `ln` Link (Unix) command
  collapsed:: true
	- The ln command is standard Unix command utility used to create ^^hard link^^ or ^^soft link^^ (symlink) to an existing file or directory.
		- Hard link - Simply known as links are objects that associate the filename with the #inode. A given file on disk could have multiple links scattered through the directory hierarchy, with all of the links being equivalent, since they all associate with the same #inode. Creating a link therefore does not copy the contents of the file but merely causes another name to be associated with the same contents. Each time a hardlink is created, a link counter that is part of inode structure gets incremented; a file is not deleted until its reference count reaches zero.
		  `ln source_file targetlink`
		- Symbolic links : Symbolic links are special files which, when encountered during pathname resolution, modify the pathname resolution to be taken to the location which the symbolic link contains. The content of the symbolic link is therefore the destination path string, which can also be examined using the readlink command line utility. The symbolic link may contain an arbitrary string which does not refer to the location of an existing file. Such a symbolic link will fail until a file is created at the location which is contained by the symbolic link. By contrast, a symbolic link to an existing file will fail if the existing file is moved to a different location (or renamed)
		  `ln -s targetfile shortcut`

- `cp` : Copy command
  collapsed:: true
	- cp is a Linux shell command to copy files and directories.
	  Syntax  $ cp [options] source dest.
	- cp command options
	  collapsed:: true
		- `cp main.c bak` Copy single file to directory
		- `cp main.c def.h /home/usr/rapid/` Copy 2 files main.c and def.h to absolute path directory
		- `cp *.c bak` Copy all .C files to directory
		- `cp src /home/usr/rapid/` Copy directory src to absolute path directory
		- `cp -R dev bak` Copy files recursively to subdirectory bak
		- `cp -f test.c bak` Force copy files
		- `cp -i test.c bak` Interactive prompt before file overwrite
		- `cp -u * bak` Copy only newer files to destination _directory_ bak
		-
- `cat` : Cat command
  collapsed:: true
	- `cat` is a standard Unix utility that reads files sequentially, writing them to standard output (STDOUT). Name derived from concatenate files.
	- `cat [options] [file_names]`
	- `cat file1.txt` Displays contents of files
	- `cat file1.txt file2.txt` Concatenate two text files and display result in the terminal
	- `cat file1.txt file2.txt > newcombinedfile.txt` Concatenate two text files and create new file
	- `cat >newfile.txt` Create a file called newfile.txt. Type desired input and press CTRL+D to finish
	- `cat file1.txt > file2.txt` Copy the contents of file1.txt to file2.txt
	- `cat file1.txt >> file2.txt` Append content of file1.txt to file2.txt

		- `find . -type f -exec grep "example" '{}' \; -print`
		  This searches every object in the current directory hierarchy (.) that is a file (-type f) and then runs the command grep "example" for every file that satisfies the conditions. The files that match are printed on the screen (-print). The curly braces ({}) are a placeholder for the find match results. The {} are enclosed in single quotes (') to avoid handing grep a malformed file name. The -exec command is terminated with a semicolon (;), which should be escaped (\;) to avoid interpretation by the shell.

		- `find / -size +50M -size -100M`   _files greater than 50MB and less than 100 MB_
	-
- `ls` : Ls command or List command
  collapsed:: true
	- List files and directories in current working directory or path given.
	- `-l` long format, permissions, number of hardlinks, owner, group, size etc
	- `-F` append a "/" to a directory and a "*" to executable files
	- `-g` display group but not owner
	- `-o` display owner but not group (when combined with -g suppresses both owner and group )
	- `-d` shows information about a symbolic link or directory rather than about the links target or listing the contents of a directory
	- `-h` output sizes in human readable format. (e.g. 1K, 235M, 2G etc. ) This option not part of POSIX standard
	- Additional options of how files are displayed
		- `-f` do not sort
		- `-t` sort the list of files by modification time
		- `-1` force output to be one entry per line
		- `-R` recursively list files in subdirectories and their subdirectories
		- `-u` List files last access time instead of last modified time
		- `--full-time` to show times with seconds and milliseconds instead of down to minute
- `chown` : Linux chown command.
  collapsed:: true
	- There are three major types of permissions : 
	  collapsed:: true
		- User permissions
		- Group permissions
		- Other premissions
	- Syntax
	  chown [-c|--changes] [-v|--verbose] [-f|--silent|--quiet] [--dereference]
	        [-h|--no-dereference] [--preserve-root]
	        [--from=currentowner:currentgroup] [--no-preserve-root]
	        [-R|--recursive] [--preserve-root] [-H] [-L] [-P]
	        {new-owner|--reference=ref-file} file ...
	- Ways to format new-owner 
	  collapsed:: true
		- `user` The name of the user to own the file. In this format, the colon (:) and the group is omitted. The owning group is not altered
		- `user:group` The user and group to own the file, separated by a colon
		- `:group` The group to own the file
		- `user:` If  group is omitted, but a colon follows user, the owner is changed to user and owning group is changed to login group of user
		- `:` Specifying a colon with no user or group is accepted, but ownership is not changed.
	- Examples
		- `sudo chown myuser myfile.txt` to change owner
		- `sudo chown notme:notmygroup myfile.txt` to change owner and group
		- `sudo chown -R myuser:mygroup otherfiles` Change the ownership of directory and all its contents recursively
	- Groups in Linux 
	  collapsed:: true
		- In Linux, a user is a member of multiple groups but it has only ^^one current group^^. The user's current group is user's group identity or **GID**.
		- When user creates a new file, the file's ownership is set to user's UID (user identity) and GID (group identity). So when a user _myuser_ creates a file, its owned by _myuser_ and also by its current group. _myuser_ can change the file's group ownership with **chown** but only **root** can change the owner to someone else
		- Each user has a configurable login group which can be any of user groups. Command to change login group is **usermod** with `-g` option
		  `sudo usermod -g newlogingroup myuser`
		- By default every Linux user has a private group, with that user as the only member.
